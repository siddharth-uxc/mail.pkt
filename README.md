Basic Mail Server Setup in Cisco Packet Tracer
In this practical, we set up a basic mail server using SMTP for sending emails and POP3 for receiving emails.

Devices Used:
Mail Server (with SMTP and POP3 services)

PCs (clients to send/receive emails)

Router & Switch (network connectivity)

Configuration Steps:
Mail Server:

Assign a static IP (e.g., 192.168.1.2).

Enable SMTP (for sending emails) and POP3 (for receiving emails) under the Services tab.

Client PCs:

Assign IPs (e.g., 192.168.1.3 for PC1).

Configure SMTP and POP3 server settings in the Email application.

Email Flow:

Sending: Emails are sent from clients to the server via SMTP.

Receiving: Clients retrieve emails from the server using POP3.

Testing:
Send and receive test emails between client PCs.

Ensure connectivity and check the server logs for email transactions.

Conclusion:
This setup simulates a basic email network using Cisco Packet Tracer, providing an understanding of SMTP and POP3 email services in a simple network environment.
